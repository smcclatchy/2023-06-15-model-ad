This workshop aims to accelerate targeted use of Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD) mouse models in preclinical studies by providing participants with hands-on training on computational approaches for concurrent analysis of omics data from both human and mouse studies. In this workshop, we will use resources from the AD Knowledge Portal (adknowledgeportal.org), a public data repository that shares data generated by multiple collaborative research programs focused on aging, dementia, and AD.
