This workshop aims to accelerate targeted use of Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD) mouse models in preclinical studies by providing participants 
with hands-on training on computational approaches for concurrent analysis of omics data from both human and mouse studies. In this 
workshop, we will use resources from the AD Knowledge Portal (adknowledgeportal.org), a public data repository that shares data 
generated by multiple collaborative research programs focused on aging, dementia, and AD. 

After attending this workshop, the participants should be able to:
<ul>
  <li>Locate data in the AD Knowledge Portal.</li>  
  <li>Annotate data with the associated metadata.</li>
  <li>Utilize state-of-the-art bioinformatics tools for rigorous QC, pre-processing and comparative analysis of transcriptomic data in R-Studio.</li> 
  <li>Perform interspecies analysis for mouse-to-human mapping of transcriptomics signatures.</li> 
  <li>Optimize study designs with insights from existing data and by incorporating robust computational workflows in their ADRD research.</li>    
</ul>
